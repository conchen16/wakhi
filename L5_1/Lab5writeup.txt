*****QUESTION 1: Phenomena*****
The changes we made in the choices file consists of general cleaning up of the lexicon and the case phenomenon in Wakhi. We also attempted to move the second position subject-marking-for-agreement clitics from the morphology section of the choices file to be auxiliaries. After doing this, we changed the word order from SOV to V2 and also deleted a few spurious lrts. While trying to run the tsdb to check the coverage of our changes, the tsdb would only process 52/683 items before getting stuck on the 53rd item. Since we had already spent a lot of time on the choices file prior to trying this, we decided to tackle this again next week.
 
We decided to clean up the lexicon because we noticed that there were verb types that were either incorrectly identified as verbs or they could be grouped together with other verbs types. We thought this might affect the input of position classes in the morphology. Here are steps of the changes we made and the change in the choices file:


In the lexicon, we deleted verb type 16 “ʃaj” meaning “kill”  and added it as a stem to the existing verb type 8 because it had the same constraints as verb type 8 which states that the subject of the verb will be nominative and the object of the verb will be accusative.

verb8_name=Trans_and_Intrans_Verbs
    verb8_feat1_name=case
    verb8_feat1_value=nom
    verb8_feat1_head=subj
    verb8_feat2_name=case
    verb8_feat2_value=accl
    verb8_feat2_head=obj
	...
    verb8_stem66_orth=ʃaj
    verb8_stem66_pred=_kill_v_rel

Based on Lab 4 feedback, we deleted the name “john” as verb type 12 and added “john” as the new noun type 36. 

 noun36_name=Names
  noun36_det=imp
    noun36_stem1_orth=john
    noun36_stem1_pred=_NO_GLOSS_n_rel

#sample IGT
john maʐ win-t
NO_GLOSS 1SG.OBL see -3SG.NPST
‘John sees me.’

We deleted verb type 63 that stated “çat” as a verb stem when it is actually a reflexive pronoun. We added “çat” as a noun type 37.

  noun37_name=Reflexive
  noun37_pron=on
  noun37_det=imp
    noun37_stem1_orth=çat
    noun37_stem1_pred=_refl_n_rel

We deleted verb type 17 that stated “məjmon” as a verb stem when it is actually the noun “guest”. We added “məjmon” to the existing noun type 16 which has the feature of 3rd person. 

 noun16_name=Common_Nouns
    noun16_feat1_name=person
    noun16_feat1_value=3rd
    …
noun16_stem92_orth=məjmon
noun16_stem92_pred=_guest_n_rel
We deleted the verb type 45 that stated that “to” was a verb stem when it is actually a 2SG oblique pronoun. We added it “to” as the new noun type 38. 

  noun38_name=2SG_obl_noun
  noun38_pron=on
    noun38_feat1_name=case
    noun38_feat1_value=obl
    noun38_feat2_name=number
    noun38_feat2_value=sg
    noun38_feat3_name=person
    noun38_feat3_value=2nd
  noun38_det=imp
    noun38_stem1_orth=to
    noun38_stem1_pred=_pron_n_rel

We deleted a spurious instance of “=əp” from noun-pc5-lrt1 since it did not have anything in common with the other instance in the lrt. We created a new position class called noun-pc25 to specify that the input of this position class is nominative pronouns. It also seems to occur on demonstrative pronouns, but we decided to only deal with the nominative ones because the demonstrative pronouns occur in different ways in the lexicon that we are still unsure of. We add the noun-pc25-lrt1 with the instance “=əp” and the feature of future tense. 

 noun-pc25_name=Noun_FUT_Suffix
  noun-pc25_order=suffix
  noun-pc25_inputs=noun27, noun29, noun32, noun33, noun36
    noun-pc25_lrt1_name=Noun_FUT_Suffix_lrt
      noun-pc25_lrt1_feat1_name=tense
      noun-pc25_lrt1_feat1_value=fut
      noun-pc25_lrt1_feat1_head=itself
      noun-pc25_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      noun-pc25_lrt1_lri1_orth==əp

#sample IGT where it seems like it won’t parse because =əp cannot be attached to John even #though we specified John as an input to =əp
John=əp puv-t
John=FUT drink-3SG.NPST
‘John will drink’

The case phenomenon we focused on this week required a lot of changes. According to our descriptive material, Wakhi has a nominative and oblique case. There is a different form in nominative and oblique cases for each of the personal pronouns. Only the personal pronouns for 3SG and 1PL are the same in nominative as they are in the oblique case. Additionally, the subjects of intransitive and transitive verbs have nominative case in both the past and nonpast tense. Only a sentence with a past transitive verb has the oblique case specified on both of the verb’s arguments.

In order to address this, we first decided to clean up spurious occurrences of oblique pronouns in the lexicon. 
We deleted “maʐ” as an aux type 6 that stated it was of form finite and mood oblig when it is actually the 1SG oblique pronoun.

  aux6_name=aux6
  aux6_sem=no-pred
    aux6_feat1_name=mood
    aux6_feat1_value=oblig
    aux6_feat1_head=verb
  aux6_subj=np-comp-case
    aux6_compfeature1_name=form
    aux6_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux6_stem1_orth=maʐ

We deleted “to” as an aux type 2 that stated it was of form finite and mood oblig when it is actually a 2SG oblique pronoun.

  aux2_name=aux2
  aux2_sem=add-pred
    aux2_feat1_name=mood
    aux2_feat1_value=oblig
    aux2_feat1_head=verb
  aux2_subj=np
    aux2_compfeature1_name=form
    aux2_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux2_stem1_orth=to
    aux2_stem1_pred=_2sg.obl_v_rel

We deleted “taw” as an aux type 7 that stated it was of form finite and mood oblig when it is actually another 2SG oblique pronoun.

  aux7_name=aux7
  aux7_sem=no-pred
    aux7_feat1_name=mood
    aux7_feat1_value=oblig
    aux7_feat1_head=verb
  aux7_subj=np-comp-case
    aux7_compfeature1_name=form
    aux7_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux7_stem1_orth=taw


We deleted “sav” as an aux type 8 that stated it was of form finite and mood oblig when it is actually the 2PL oblique pronoun.

  aux8_name=aux8
  aux8_sem=no-pred
    aux8_feat1_name=mood
    aux8_feat1_value=oblig
    aux8_feat1_head=verb
  aux8_subj=np-comp-case
    aux8_compfeature1_name=form
    aux8_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux8_stem1_orth=sav

Deleting these spurious aux types caused errors in the morphology where position classes took these aux types as input. It caused an error in verb-pc27 (input: aux2), verb-pc28 (input: aux6), verb-pc29 (input: aux7), and verb-pc30 (input: aux8). Each of these position classes had one lrt with 2 features. It was the person and number features corresponding to the input of the position class. For example, verb-pc27 took aux2 as input. Originally, aux2 was “to” which is actually a 2SG.OBL pronoun. Therefore, verb-pc27-lrt1 had the features 2SG. The same applies for the lrt in the other 3 position classes. The system also did not specify any affix for these lrts, so we deleted the 4 verb position classes.

      verb-pc30_lrt1_feat2_head=subj
      verb-pc30_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no

The system had recognized “maʐ”, “taw”, “to”, and “sav” as pronouns and added them as noun types so we did not have to add them in.

In order to address the phenomenon that the primary cases used in Wakhi are nominative and oblique, we turned our attention to our verb type 8 which had the most stems. Verb 8 consists of transitive and intransitive verb stems. It had features saying that the subject of the verb would be nominative and the object of the verb would be accusative. Since accusative is not a primary case of Wakhi but instead oblique we decided to change the feature of this large verb type.
We were conflicted between whether or not to delete the accusative feature and have the only feature be that subjects of the verb were nominative. Afraid that it would create too much ambiguity, we decided to specify that the object of the verb is case oblique instead of accusative. 

  verb8_name=Trans_and_Intrans_Verbs
    verb8_feat1_name=case
    verb8_feat1_value=nom
    verb8_feat1_head=subj
    verb8_feat2_name=case
    verb8_feat2_value=obl
    verb8_feat2_head=obj

*****QUESTION 2: MMT*****
Since there were some words in the eng.txt that didn’t exist in the Wakhi corpus, I swapped “chase” for “hit, “park” for “store”, and “hungry” for “sad”. Then I translated the sentence by searching for the correct stem in the item file and then adding additional information to the stems based on the descriptive material.  

	ʃatʃ-iʃt kar-v di-ən
	dog-PL.NOM car-OBL.PL hit-3PL.NPST
	'Dogs hit cars.'

For example, I knew the SOV ordering makes the sentence look like “Dogs cars hit”. I take the root word “dog” and searched the grammar for a plural inflection which also happened to be the nominative inflection. I did the same with “car” but searched for an oblique case version of the plural inflection after deducing there must be one if there was a plural inflection carrying nominative case information. (Yes, the glosses in the item file are PL.NOM and OBL.PL, not PL.OBL in case you thought it was a typo!) I took the stem for the verb “hit” and added the correct subject agreement suffix in the non-past tense since Wakhi does not have a present tense.

“Who asked that the dogs hit” and “I asked that the dogs hit” could not be translated to Wakhi because there’s no information in the descriptive grammar or any instance in the test corpus of embedded interrogative clauses. 
We could not translate “The dogs sleep because the cat sleeps” because we had no equivalent for “because” besides the conjunction “and” which isn’t similar enough to be a replacement. 
We do not think the sentences “Who sleeps”, “What do the dogs hit”, and “What do you think the dogs hit” with Wh- questions will translate because we have not yet addressed this phenomenon in the choices file. 
 
*****QUESTION 3: MT *****
There were no difficulties running the MT. The first sentence “Dogs sleep” generated about 48k sentences which is related to the fact that there are spurious occurrences of clitics in our grammar.  For example one of the generated sentences was 
	ʃatʃ rɨçɨp-t-tk=i
	Dog sleep-PST-PRF=3SG
Which shows the incorrect tense and agreement information. A more accurate generation should look something like the following:
	ʃatʃ-iʃt rɨçɨp-ən
	dog-PL.NOM sleep-3SG.NPST

*****QUESTION 4*****

4.1 Initial test corpus
1. How many items parsed? 155 / 683
2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?6.65
3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive? 136

4.2 Final test corpus
1. How many items parsed? 158 / 683
2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 7.22
3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive? 136
4.What sources of ambiguity can you identify? 
	zilzila=ʂ wəz-t
	earthquake =PROG come -3SG.NPST 
	‘There was an earthquake.’
This shows that “-t” can be licensed by 2 lrts. One has the features 3SG.NPST and the other has the feature -PST. This seems to cause ambiguity often because these tenses are used often.

4.3 Initial testsuite
1. How many items parsed? 25
2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 3.4
3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive? 23

4.4 Final testsuite
1. How many items parsed? 26
2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item? 6.5
3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive? 23
4.What sources of ambiguity can you identify? 
	ʃatʃ-iʃt kar-v di-ən
	dog-PL.NOM car-OBL.PL hit-3PL.NPST
	'Dogs hit cars.'
This shows that “hit” is licensed by both the 3PL.NPST lrt and 1PL.NPST lrt. This is an unavoidable ambiguity since the descriptive grammar states that there are no distinctions between the two. 

SEMANTICS:
#480
wuz=əm plan-t-i
1SG.NOM ==1SG fall -PST -PST
I fell.
The semantics looks reasonable. There are predictions “exist_q_rel”, “_pron_n_rel”, and “_fall_v_rel”. “exist_q_rel” modifies “_pron_n_rel”, and “_fall_v_rel” take “_pron_n_rel” as the second argument. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#290
maʐ taw win-tu
1SG.OBL 2SG.OBL see -PLPF 
I saw you.
The semantics doesn’t seem to match up with the IGT. There is a _and_coord_rel predication that does not exist in the IGT. The ARG0 in the verb predication _see_v_rel is identified with the INDEX of the sentence. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#1850
zəm di-tu
snow hit -PLPF 
It snowed.
The semantics looks reasonable. The predications describing snow are exist_q_rel and _snow_n_rel where ARG0 of _snow_n_rel is identified with the ARG0 of the exist_q_rel that comes from the constituent being an NP. The verb has the _hit_v_rel predication where it’s ARG2 is identified with the ARG0 of both exist_q_rel and _snow_n_rel. The ARG0 of _hit_v_rel is identified with the INDEX of the sentence. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#2140
sajiʃt=əv=ʂ gəfs-t-i
2PL.NOM ==2PL =PROG run -PST -PST
You (pl.) were running.
The semantics looks reasonable. There is a predication for sajiʃt=əv=ʂ that has _pron_n_rel since it is a pronoun as well as an exist_q_rel predication that is a result of the constituent being an NP. The verb gəfs-t-i also has the reasonable predication of _run_v_rel which takes the pronoun as its ARG1. The ARG0 of value of the verb is identified with the INDEX of the sentence. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#750
j-a-w gəfs-t
DEM -MED PRO run -3SG.NPST
(S)he will run.
The semantics looks reasonable. There are predictions for both “j-a-w” and “gəfs-t”. “j-a-w” has the predications “_exist_q_rel” and “_pron_n_rel”. “Gəfs-t” has the predication “_run_v_rel” which take “_exist_q_rel” and “_pron_n_rel” as argument. The index of the mrs comes from “_run_v_rel”.

#2490
j-a-w-i çat win-tu
DEM -MED PRO -OBL REFL see -PLPF 
S/he saw herself/himself.
The semantics does not match up with the IGT. The _and_coord_rel does not belong because there is no coordination occurring in the sentence according to the IGT. Additionally the exist_q_rel predication with ARG0 identified with the C-ARG of the coordination predication. The _see_v_rel has an ARG2 value identified with the C-ARG of the coordination predication and the irrelevant exist_q_rel predication. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#3950
wuz=ʂ dam xaʂ-əm
1SG.NOM =PROG breath pull -1SG.NPST
I breathe.
The semantics looks reasonable. There is a predication for “wuz=ʂ” that has _pron_n_rel since it’s a pronoun as well as an exist_q_rel predication that modify the pronoun. “dam” also has a similar pair of predications (_pron_n_rel and exist_q_rel). Finally, “xaʂ-əm” has a “_pull_v_rel” predication which take both “wuz=ʂ” and  “dam” as argument.

#3170
wuz=əm retʂ-tu
1SG.NOM ==1SG go -PLPF 
I left.
The semantics looks reasonable. There is a predication for wuz=əm that has _pron_n_rel since it is a pronoun as well as an exist_q_rel predication that is a result of the constituent being an NP. The verb retʂ-tu also has the reasonable predication of _go_v_rel which takes the pronoun as its ARG1. The ARG0 of value of the verb is identified with the INDEX of the sentence. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#3930
retʂ-tu=əm
go -PLPF ==1SG
I left.
The semantics looks reasonable.The only predication we have is _go_v_rel. The pronoun is encoded in ARG1 as 1SG. This is the same semantics as the previous grammar.

#3960
maʐ zumbuj-t
1SG.OBL yawn -PST
I just yawned.
The semantics looks reasonable. There are predictions for both “maʐ” and “zumbuj-t”. “maʐ” has the predications “_exist_q_rel” and “_pron_n_rel”. “zumbuj-t” has the predication “_yawn_v_rel” which take “_exist_q_rel” and “_pron_n_rel” as argument. The index of the mrs comes from “_yawn_v_rel”.
